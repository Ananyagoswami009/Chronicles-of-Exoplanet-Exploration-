This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

ðŸš€ Chronicles of Exoplanet Exploration: Bridging the Gap Between Science and Learning ðŸš€

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest project â€“ Chronicles of Exoplanet Exploration â€“ a web-based platform designed to make complex exoplanetary science accessible, engaging, and interactive for learners of all backgrounds. Using cutting-edge technologies such as Three.js, Next.js, Node.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript, I built an immersive 3D website that visualizes exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy, bringing the mysteries of space to life.

What makes this platform unique is its integration of Gemini AI-powered quizzes that generate dynamic questions at three different difficulty levels. This AI-driven approach tailors the learning experience, helping users progressively build their knowledge of exoplanets through personalized, interactive quizzes. Additionally, I leveraged tools like Cursor AI, V0 AI, Google AI Studio, and ChatGPT to enhance development efficiency, content generation, and workflow automation.

The Three.js 3D visualization feature allows users to explore exoplanets as if navigating through space, providing an engaging experience far beyond static text or images. With a curated library of study materials sourced from trusted astrophysics organizations and research papers, the platform not only educates but also inspires curiosity about our universeâ€™s vast unknowns.

Key Benefits:

Accessibility & Engagement: The 3D visualization and AI-driven quizzes make space science more accessible, captivating users of all ages.

Personalized Learning: AI-powered quizzes adapt to the user's comprehension level, creating a dynamic and self-paced learning journey.

Global Reach: As a web-based platform, it democratizes knowledge, offering space enthusiasts and learners worldwide a rich educational experience.

Inspiration: By combining advanced technologies and interactive learning, we aim to foster scientific curiosity and inspire the next generation of astronomers and space scientists.

Future Goals:

Multiplayer Mode: Introducing a real-time multiplayer quiz feature to encourage collaboration and competition among learners.

Virtual Reality (VR) Integration: Expanding the platform to provide an even more immersive space exploration experience.

Collaboration with Educators: Partnering with schools and universities to integrate this tool into classroom learning.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Three.js: For creating stunning 3D visualizations of the Milky Way galaxy and exoplanets.

Next.js: For seamless frontend performance and navigation.

Node.js: For backend operations and server-side logic.

TailwindCSS: For building responsive and modern user interfaces.

TypeScript: Ensuring type safety and maintaining clean, maintainable code.

Gemini AI: AI-driven quiz generation to enhance interactive learning.

Cursor AI, V0 AI, Google AI Studio, & ChatGPT: Used for workflow automation, content generation, and improving user engagement.

By blending cutting-edge technologies and AI, this platform not only aims to educate but also inspire curiosity about exoplanet exploration. Iâ€™m excited about the potential impact this project can have on democratizing space science education and fostering a global community of space enthusiasts.

Letâ€™s continue to explore the mysteries of our universe, one exoplanet at a time! ðŸŒŒðŸ“š
